# Analyze, Remediate, Retesting and Accept the Risk

After receiving the penetration test report, there are several steps you can take, such as remediation, accepting the risk, or rejecting the findings.

Here’s a brief overview of actions you can take once the penetration test report is ready.

## Analyze

When deciding to address a vulnerability, the first and most crucial step is to allocate sufficient time to analyze and interpret the report. Your employees responsible for the penetration test should consider the following questions:

- Does this vulnerability meet the risk threshold we have agreed upon internally?
- What is the actual (business) impact of a possible vulnerability exploitation, considering factors that may not be known to the penetration tester?
- Who will be responsible for remediating each finding?

## Remediate

Before taking any further actions, it’s crucial to verify that the vulnerability is reproducible. This not only enhances your understanding of the issue but also helps identify the systems at risk and different intrusion techniques.

To initiate the remediation phase, it’s essential to comprehend the scope of what needs to be fixed. While technical fixes may be necessary, there could also be underlying causes, such as:

- Management practices that require improvements;
- Alternative approaches;
- Ineffective or overly permissive security policies;
- Communication issues within or between departments.

Nevertheless, in most cases, a technical fix must be implemented. We advise remediating the findings as soon as possible, as the chances of the penetration tester still being intimately familiar with the vulnerability are higher, and the probability of an exploitation is lower.

## Retest

At Oneleet, we are committed to safeguarding your company. We provide free retesting for a year after the penetration test is delivered, giving you ample time to address vulnerabilities and improve your company’s security posture. However, it’s crucial to adhere to your internal policy regarding vulnerability remediation, particularly in light of compliance requirements such as SOC 2, PCI, or ISO 27001.

## Accepting the risk

Marking vulnerabilities as `Accepted Risk` on our platform is entirely at your discretion. We recognize that each client may have a higher or lower internal risk threshold for remediation, and we respect your decision if the analyzed impact is deemed too low to warrant action.

However, we advise against accepting vulnerabilities with a `Medium` or higher risk. As these vulnerabilities pose a growing business risk, they are not a matter of if but when they will impact your organization. Therefore, ensure that you allocate sufficient time and effort to remediate these risks effectively.

Our recommendation is to always provide a clear reason for accepting a risk. This rationale will be included in the penetration test report, allowing you to offer additional context to internal and external stakeholders regarding the acceptability of the risk.

# PCI DSS Penetration Test

If you hired Oneleet for a PCI-DSS penetration test, there will be a few minor differences compared to our regular penetration testing process. The primary objectives of the PCI-DSS penetration test are to:

- Validate that the cardholder data environment (CDE) is isolated, secure, and compliant with PCI DSS standards.
- Ensure that the CHD is protected from unauthorized access.
- Identify and remediate vulnerabilities that could compromise the CHD.

As a result, the following processes will be slightly different:

- The scope of the penetration test.
- The documentation before the PCI DSS Application penetration test.
- The frequency of penetration testing.

## Scoping of a PCI DSS Application Penetration Test:

During the scoping call, in addition to the already mentioned points, the following aspects will also be considered for a PCI DDS application penetration test:

- **Application Security Testing**
  - Test all applications within the CDE that handle CHD to identify security vulnerabilities, including those that adhere to OWASP standards. This involves evaluating for common threats such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), authentication vulnerabilities, and authorization flaws.
- **External Application Testing**
  - Simulate attacks on externally accessible applications that provide access to or protect CHD. External testing verifies the security of internet-facing applications by identifying misconfigurations, exposed ports, and external access vulnerabilities.
- **Internal Application Testing**
  - Perform assessments on applications accessible from within the internal network. This involves testing for unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and potential risks of lateral movement if a user gains unauthorized access to the CDE.
- **Segmentation Testing**
  - Confirm that network segmentation effectively isolates CHD-related applications from the rest of the environment, minimizing the PCI scope.

## Documentation provided before the PCI DSS Application Penetration Test:

Consider providing the following documentation after or before the scoping call:

- A network diagram illustrating all network segments within the scope of the test;
- A cardholder data flow diagram;
- A list of all anticipated services and ports exposed at the CDE perimeter;
- Details on how authorized users access the CDE;
- A list of all network segments that have been isolated from the CDE to minimize the scope.

## Frequency of PCI DSS penetration tests

According to **PCI DSS Requirements 11.3.1 and 11.3.2**, penetration testing is mandatory at least annually and after any substantial alterations to the network environment. These alterations may encompass infrastructure upgrades, application modifications, or the installation of novel system components.

The definition of a **“significant change”** fluctuates based on an **organization’s risk assessment** process and the specific configuration of its environment. Since PCI DSS doesn’t provide a rigid definition of a significant change, it’s up to each entity to assess whether a change could potentially compromise network security or expose cardholder data. If a modification could potentially affect security or access to cardholder data, it’s generally regarded as significant and should prompt a penetration test.

### Example of a Significant Change:

**Migration to a New Firewall System**: Upgrading or replacing the firewall safeguarding the CDE is a substantial change because it directly affects network security. This transition could introduce novel configurations, alter network paths, and influence data flow, potentially compromising cardholder data. Given the critical role firewalls play in security, a penetration test is essential to validate that security controls are functioning as intended.

### Example of a Non Significant Change:

**Patch for a Non-CDE System**: Applying a minor software patch to a system outside the CDE that doesn’t interact with or impact cardholder data would be considered a non-significant change. This maintenance doesn’t alter security controls in the CDE or affect access to sensitive data, so a penetration test under PCI DSS is not necessary.
