# Penetration Testing High-level Overview

![](/penetration-testing/process.png)

1. **Scope**

- 30-minute scoping call, in which our penetration tester will be present.
- We expect you to provide a comprehensive overview of the product, including a demo of the application. While an architectural design is not mandatory, it would be appreciated.
- A showcase of Oneleet’s platform used for vulnerability management is provided.
- The assigned penetration tester will attend the meeting and ask questions to better understand your application/infrastructure.
- The Rules of Engagement will be discussed (timeline, scope, ways of communication, etc.)
- After the scoping call we will send over a summary of what was discussed.

2. **Prepare**

- Provide the necessary permissions and details of the environment discussed during the scoping call, including user accounts, IP addresses, and possibly required credentials. A summary of the required information will be provided after the scoping call.
- An invitation will be sent to your team in charge of supervising the penetration test to create an account on Oneleet’s platform.

3. **Test**

- Any found critical vulnerabilities will be immediately brought to your attention via Slack.
- Using various tactics, techniques and procedures to identify security caveats, our penetration testers will attempt to exploit the identified vulnerabilities to assess how deeply they can penetrate the system.

4. **Report**

- All discovered vulnerabilities will be uploaded on Oneleet’s platform.
- After the engagement concludes, our internal team will revise the Penetration Test Report, which will be made available within 2 to 3 business days.
- The final Penetration Test Report will include an executive summary, risk ratings, detailed findings, and recommendations.

5. **Remediate**

- If necessary, you can remediate the vulnerabilities, and our penetration tester will retest the system within a couple of days.
- At this stage, you also have the option to accept the risk or reject the vulnerability.
- Once all findings have been addressed, an updated report will reflect the new state of each finding.

6. **Evaluate**

- For instance, discuss any unaddressed risks that your company accepted, confirming that these decisions align with your risk management strategy. Ensure that the risk remains acceptable over time.
