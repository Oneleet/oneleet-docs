# Penetration Testing Types

At Oneleet, we tailor our approach to meet each client’s needs. We recognize that businesses vary in size, goals, and requirements, so we develop customized strategies for success.

Generally, there are three types of penetration testing scenarios. Sometimes, there’s also a distinction made between internal and external penetration testing. Let’s break it down:

## White Box Penetration Testing

The tester possesses complete knowledge of the system’s source code, architecture, and network details. This scenario resembles an attacker with in-depth understanding of the system’s inner workings. Such an attacker could be a disgruntled employee, a contractor, or someone who has gained unauthorized access to sensitive internal information.

## Gray Box penetration Testing

The tester may have limited access to internal documentation or user credentials, which could be exploited by an attacker with some inside information or limited access to the system.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This is the type of penetration testing we most often recommend to our
  clients, as it provides a balanced approach in terms breadth, and depth.
  However, depending on the company's nature, product, and likely attack
  vectors, other types of penetration testing might be more relevant.

## Black Box Penetration Testing

The tester, lacking prior knowledge of the system, adopts an external hacker’s perspective. The simulated attacker embodies a hacker attempting to breach the system from the outside. They employ techniques such as reconnaissance, social engineering, and vulnerability scanning to identify potential weaknesses.

## External vs Internal Penetration Testing

**External Penetration Testing** simulates an attack originating from outside the organization, specifically targeting internet-facing assets such as web applications, firewalls, and public servers. The primary objective is to uncover vulnerabilities that an external attacker could potentially exploit. Common targets include websites, virtual private networks (VPNs), and cloud resources. These tests encompass a range of scenarios, including misconfigurations, compromised passwords, and outdated software.

**Internal Penetration Testing** simulates an attacker who has already gained access to the internal network. It focuses on internal security controls, access permissions, and lateral movement capabilities, targeting internal systems, applications, and sensitive data.
