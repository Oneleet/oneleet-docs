# Troubleshooting

## The Oneleet Agent isn't working (general troubleshooting)

Follow these steps and check after each one to see if the Oneleet Agent starts working:

<Steps>
### Check if the Oneleet Agent is running

First, follow the steps in the [Setup Guide](/oneleet-agent/setup) to install and start the Oneleet Agent. Then, review the [Once the Oneleet Agent is running, where can I find it?](/oneleet-agent/faq#once-the-oneleet-agent-is-running-where-can-i-find-it) section of our FAQ to get familiar with where to find the Oneleet Agent menu once it's installed and running.

If you still can't confirm if the Oneleet Agent is running or not, try the final step below to see if it's running:

<Tabs items={['macOS', 'Windows', 'Linux']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  Open **Activity Monitor** and search for "Oneleet":

  <Tabs.Tab>
  Open **Task Manager** and search for "Oneleet" in the **Processes** tab:

![Windows Task Manager](/oneleet-agent/windows-task-manager.png)

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  In your terminal, run:
  ```bash
  ps aux | grep oneleet
  ```
  
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

If you've confirmed that the Oneleet Agent isn't running after following the steps above, skip to the [Restart your device](#restart-your-device) step below.

### Log out and log in again

If already logged in, log out by opening the Oneleet Agent menu and clicking on **Help** > **Logout**.
You should then be prompted to log in again automatically, but if not, open the Oneleet Agent menu and click on **Open**.

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ![Windows logout](/oneleet-agent/windows-logout.png)

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Check if your Oneleet Agent version is up to date

To check if your version of the Oneleet Agent is up to date, open the Oneleet Agent menu and click on **Settings** > **Check for Updates**.

<Tabs items={['macOS', 'Windows']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ![Windows check for updates](/oneleet-agent/windows-check-for-updates.png)

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Quit and restart the Oneleet Agent

Quiting and restarting the Oneleet Agent can sometimes resolve temporary issues or conflicts. To quit the Oneleet Agent, open the Oneleet Agent menu and click on **Quit**. If you're unsure how to start the Oneleet agent again, see the [Setup Guide](/oneleet-agent/setup).

  <Tabs.Tab>![Windows restart](/oneleet-agent/windows-quit.png)</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Restart your device

Restarting your device can also resolve temporary issues or conflicts.

### Reinstall the Oneleet Agent

First, follow the uninstallation steps in the [Setup Guide](/oneleet-agent/setup). Once uninstalled, and follow the download and installation steps to download and install a fresh copy of the Oneleet Agent.

### Ensure your operating system is up to date

An out-of-date operating system could lead to issues with the Oneleet Agent. Ensure your operating system is up to date by checking for updates in your system settings.

### Delete all Oneleet Agent app data

As a last resort, try deleting all app data and configuration for the Oneleet Agent.

First make sure to first quit the Oneleet Agent. Then, delete the app data folder for the Oneleet Agent. The location of this folder depends on your operating system:

<Tabs items={['macOS', 'Windows', 'Linux']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  Delete the `~/Library/Application Support/Oneleet Agent` folder.
    - To find the **Library** folder, open a new Finder window and press `Command` + `Shift` + `L` to directly open it.

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  Delete the `%APPDATA%\Oneleet Agent` folder.
    - To find the **AppData** folder, either open a new File Explorer window and enter `%APPDATA%` in the address bar, or press `Windows` + `R` to open the Run dialog, then type `%APPDATA%` and press `Enter`.

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  Delete the `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/oneleet` or `~/.config/oneleet` folder.
  
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
Once you've deleted this folder, restart the Oneleet Agent and log back in.

## macOS

### I can't see the Oneleet icon in my menu bar

If you can't see the Oneleet icon in your Mac's menu bar, either the Oneleet Agent is not running, or it may simply be hidden because there are too many apps displaying in your menu bar and not enough space to display an icon for the Oneleet Agent.

First, check to make sure the Oneleet Agent is actually running by following the [Check if the Oneleet Agent is running](#check-if-the-oneleet-agent-is-running) step in the general troubleshooting section above.

If you've confirmed that it's running but still can't see the Oneleet icon in your menu bar, try freeing up some space in your menu bar to make room for the Oneleet icon by temporarily right-clicking and quitting some of the apps in your menu bar. A general rule of thumb is that if you quit one of the apps in your menu bar and a new app icon appears on the lefthand side of the menu bar that you didn't see before, the Oneleet icon is likely being hidden because of a lack of space in the menu bar.

## Windows

### BitLocker / Device Encryption is not working

Here are the steps to determine why Device Encryption might not be available:

1. From **Start** type "System Information", right-click System Information in the list of results, then select "Run as administrator"
2. In the System Summary - Item's list, look for the value of Automatic Device Encryption Support or Device Encryption Support. The **value** describes the support status of Device Encryption:
   - Meets prerequisites: Device Encryption is available on your device
   - TPM is not usable: your device doesn't have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), or the TPM isn't enabled in the BIOS or in the UEFI
   - WinRE is not configured: your device doesn't have Windows Recovery Environment configured
   - PCR7 binding is not supported: Secure Boot is disabled in the BIOS/UEFI, or you have peripherals connected to your device during boot (like specialized network interfaces, docking stations, or external graphic cards)

For more information, see Microsoft's [documentation on device encryption in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-encryption-in-windows-cf7e2b6f-3e70-4882-9532-18633605b7df).
