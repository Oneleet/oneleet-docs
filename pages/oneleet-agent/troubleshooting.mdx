## Windows

### BitLocker / Device Encryption is not working

Here are the steps to determine why Device Encryption might not be available:

1. From **Start** type "System Information", right-click System Information in the list of results, then select "Run as administrator"
2. In the System Summary - Item's list, look for the value of Automatic Device Encryption Support or Device Encryption Support. The **value** describes the support status of Device Encryption:
    - Meets prerequisites: Device Encryption is available on your device
    - TPM is not usable: your device doesn't have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), or the TPM isn't enabled in the BIOS or in the UEFI
    - WinRE is not configured: your device doesn't have Windows Recovery Environment configured
    - PCR7 binding is not supported: Secure Boot is disabled in the BIOS/UEFI, or you have peripherals connected to your device during boot (like specialized network interfaces, docking stations, or external graphic card)
