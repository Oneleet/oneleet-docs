# Troubleshooting

## The Oneleet Agent isn't working (general troubleshooting)

Follow these steps and check after each one to see if the Oneleet Agent starts working:

<Steps>
### Check if the Oneleet Agent is running

First, follow the steps in the [Setup Guide](/oneleet-agent/setup) to install and start the Oneleet Agent. Then, review the [Once the Oneleet Agent is running, where can I find it?](/oneleet-agent/faq#once-the-oneleet-agent-is-running-where-can-i-find-it) section of our FAQ to get familiar with where to find the Oneleet Agent menu once it's installed and running.

If you still can't confirm if the Oneleet Agent is running or not, try the final step below to see if it's running:

<Tabs items={['macOS', 'Windows', 'Linux']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  Open **Activity Monitor** and search for "Oneleet":

![macOS Activity Monitor](/oneleet-agent/macos-activity-monitor.png)

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  Open **Task Manager** and search for "Oneleet" in the **Processes** tab:

![Windows Task Manager](/oneleet-agent/windows-task-manager.png)

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  In your terminal, run:
  ```bash
  ps aux | grep oneleet
  ```
  
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Make sure the Oneleet Agent has the permissions it needs (macOS only)

On macOS, the Oneleet Agent needs certain permissions enabled in order to run properly. To check if it has the permissions it needs, follow the steps below:

1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Automation**
2. Click on **Oneleet** to expand it and see which permissions are enabled
3. Make sure the **System Settings** and **System Events** permissions are both enabled

![macOS permissions](/oneleet-agent/macos-permissions.png)

If you made any changes to enable the permissions, you'll need to quit and restart the Oneleet Agent to apply them.

### Quit and restart the Oneleet Agent

Quitting and restarting the Oneleet Agent can sometimes resolve temporary issues or conflicts. To quit the Oneleet Agent, open the Oneleet Agent menu and click on **Quit**. If you're unsure how to start the Oneleet agent again, see the [Setup Guide](/oneleet-agent/setup).

<Tabs items={["macOS", "Windows"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>![macOS restart](/oneleet-agent/macos-quit.png)</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>![Windows restart](/oneleet-agent/windows-quit.png)</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

If you can't find the Oneleet Agent menu, see the [Once the Oneleet Agent is running, where can I find it?](/oneleet-agent/faq#once-the-oneleet-agent-is-running-where-can-i-find-it) section of our FAQ. If you still can't find the Oneleet Agent menu after this, try finding and quitting the Oneleet Agent process directly:

<Tabs items={["macOS", "Windows", "Linux"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    1. Open **Activity Monitor** and search for "Oneleet" 
    2. Click on the Oneleet Agent process in the list and click the **X** button towards the top of the window
    3. Click on the **Quit** button in the dialog that appears.
    4. If that doesn't work, follow step 2 again and click the **Force Quit** button instead.

    ![macOS quit](/oneleet-agent/macos-quit-activity-monitor.png)

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    1. Open **Task Manager** and search for "Oneleet" in the **Processes** tab
    2. Right-click on the Oneleet Agent process in the list and click **End Task**

    ![Windows quit](/oneleet-agent/windows-quit-task-manager.png)

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    1. In your terminal, run `ps aux | grep oneleet`
    2. Find the Oneleet Agent process in the output and note its PID (process ID) in the second column
    3. Kill the process by running: `kill <PID>` (replace `<PID>` with the process ID)
    4. If that doesn't work, force kill it with: `kill -9 <PID>`

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Log out and log in again

If already logged in, log out by opening the Oneleet Agent menu and clicking on **Help** > **Logout**.
You should then be prompted to log in again automatically, but if not, open the Oneleet Agent menu and click on **Open**.

<Tabs items={['macOS', 'Windows']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ![macOS logout](/oneleet-agent/macos-logout.png)

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ![Windows logout](/oneleet-agent/windows-logout.png)

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Check if your Oneleet Agent version is up to date

To check if your version of the Oneleet Agent is up to date, open the Oneleet Agent menu and click on **Settings** > **Check for Updates**.

<Tabs items={['macOS', 'Windows']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ![macOS check for updates](/oneleet-agent/macos-check-for-updates.png)

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  ![Windows check for updates](/oneleet-agent/windows-check-for-updates.png)

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Restart your device

Restarting your device can also resolve temporary issues or conflicts.

### Reinstall the Oneleet Agent

First, follow the uninstallation steps in the [Setup Guide](/oneleet-agent/setup). Once uninstalled, follow the download and installation steps to download and install a fresh copy of the Oneleet Agent.

### Ensure your operating system is up to date

An out-of-date operating system could lead to issues with the Oneleet Agent. Ensure your operating system is up to date by checking for updates in your system settings.

### Delete all Oneleet Agent app data

As a last resort, try deleting all app data and configuration for the Oneleet Agent.

First make sure to quit the Oneleet Agent. Then, delete the app data folder for the Oneleet Agent. The location of this folder depends on your operating system:

<Tabs items={['macOS', 'Windows', 'Linux']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  Delete the `~/Library/Application Support/Oneleet Agent` folder.
    - To find the **Library** folder, open a new Finder window and press `Command` + `Shift` + `L` to directly open it.

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  Delete the `%APPDATA%\Oneleet Agent` folder.
    - To find the **AppData** folder, either open a new File Explorer window and enter `%APPDATA%` in the address bar, or press `Windows` + `R` to open the Run dialog, then type `%APPDATA%` and press `Enter`.

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
  Delete the `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/oneleet` or `~/.config/oneleet` folder.
  
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
Once you've deleted this folder, restart the Oneleet Agent and log back in.

If the above still doesn't resolve the issue, please follow the [delete all Oneleet Agent app data](#delete-all-oneleet-agent-app-data) step in the general troubleshooting section above.

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    1. Open the Oneleet Agent menu in your Linux desktop panel
    2. Hover over **Settings** in the dropdown menu that appears
    3. Ensure the **Launch Oneleet at login** setting is checked off in the submenu that appears

</Tabs>

## macOS

### I can't see the Oneleet icon in my menu bar

If you can't see the Oneleet icon in your Mac's menu bar, this could either be because the Oneleet Agent is not running, the Oneleet Agent is missing required permissions to run properly, or because there are simply too many apps displaying in your menu bar and not enough space to display an icon for the Oneleet Agent.

1. First, check to make sure the Oneleet Agent is actually running by following the [Check if the Oneleet Agent is running](#check-if-the-oneleet-agent-is-running) step in the general troubleshooting section above.

2. If you've confirmed that the Oneleet Agent is running but still can't see the Oneleet icon in your menu bar, follow the [Make sure the Oneleet Agent has the permissions it needs (macOS only)](#make-sure-the-oneleet-agent-has-the-permissions-it-needs-macos-only) step in the general troubleshooting section above to make sure the Oneleet Agent has the permissions it needs to run properly.

3. If you've confirmed that the Oneleet Agent is running and has the required permissions but still can't see the Oneleet icon in your menu bar, try freeing up space in your menu bar by temporarily quitting some menu bar apps (right-click and quit). If quitting an app reveals a new icon on the left side of the menu bar that you didn't see before, the Oneleet icon is likely hidden due to lack of space.

### Autofix isn't working

If autofix isn't working, see the [Make sure the Oneleet Agent has the permissions it needs (macOS only)](#make-sure-the-oneleet-agent-has-the-permissions-it-needs-macos-only) step in the general troubleshooting section above to make sure the Oneleet Agent has the permissions it needs to update the settings on your device.

## Windows

### BitLocker / Device Encryption is not working

Here are the steps to determine why Device Encryption might not be available:

1. From **Start** type "System Information", right-click System Information in the list of results, then select "Run as administrator"
2. In the System Summary - Item's list, look for the value of Automatic Device Encryption Support or Device Encryption Support. The **value** describes the support status of Device Encryption:
   - Meets prerequisites: Device Encryption is available on your device
   - TPM is not usable: your device doesn't have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), or the TPM isn't enabled in the BIOS or in the UEFI
   - WinRE is not configured: your device doesn't have Windows Recovery Environment configured
   - PCR7 binding is not supported: Secure Boot is disabled in the BIOS/UEFI, or you have peripherals connected to your device during boot (like specialized network interfaces, docking stations, or external graphic cards)

For more information, see Microsoft's [documentation on device encryption in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/device-encryption-in-windows-cf7e2b6f-3e70-4882-9532-18633605b7df).

## Ubuntu

### "The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly"

Canonical recently [changed Ubuntu's default AppArmor profiles](https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-23-10-restricted-unprivileged-user-namespaces) to restrict usage of a kernel feature required for Chromium sandboxing. As an Electron app, the Oneleet Agent uses Chromium sandboxing as a security measure, and it will refuse to start if it cannot create the sandbox.

We plan to resolve this in a future update by automatically configuring an AppArmor policy for the Agent. In the meantime, you can add the policy yourself by creating a file at `/etc/apparmor.d/oneleetagent` with the following content:

```ansi copy
abi <abi/4.0>,
include <tunables/global>

profile oneleetagent /path/to/oneleet-agent flags=(default_allow) {
  userns,

  # Site-specific additions and overrides. See local/README for details.
  include if exists <local/oneleetagent>
}
```

Replace `/path/to/oneleet-agent` as follows:

- If you installed the `.deb`, use the path to the `oneleet-agent` binary (`/usr/bin/oneleet-agent` by default).
- If you're using the AppImage, use the path to the `.AppImage` file.

Once you've created the file, apply it to your system with `sudo systemctl reload apparmor.service`.

See [this answer on Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/a/1528215) for additional context.
