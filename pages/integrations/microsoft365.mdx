## Updates

### 2026-01-30

#### What's changing?

We're updating our Microsoft 365 integration to more reliably monitor your Microsoft Entra ID security policies. As part of this change, we now require the following **additional permissions**:
- Policy.Read.All - Read-only access to Entra ID policies

After this change, your monitors should exhibit fewer false positives.

#### Action required

Please reconnect your Microsoft 365 integration and accept the new permissions as soon as possible.

1. On the Oneleet platform, go to Integrations → Microsoft 365 → "Settings" tab.
2. Under **Active connections**, find your connection and click **Reconnect**. Do **not** remove the entire integration.
3. Click "Connect", and authorize the new permissions.

Repeat this for any additional Microsoft 365 connections you have.
