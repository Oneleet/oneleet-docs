### Which permissions does Oneleet require?

- Repository metadata (read)

- Repository checks (read and write)
- Repository pull requests (read and write)

## Updates

### 2025-10-14

#### What's changing?

We’ll soon be adding support for running Oneleet Code Security scanning as a continuous integration check on your GitHub pull requests, so you can find and remediate security issues before they're introduced to production.

As part of this change, you should have received a message from GitHub to review and accept the following new permissions for the **Oneleet Code Security** app:

- Read and write access to **Checks** on repositories
- Read and write access to **Pull requests** on repositories

Once you've accepted the new permissions, you should be ready to go for pull request scanning. We'll have more to share about this feature very soon!
