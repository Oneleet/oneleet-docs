### Troubleshooting Connection Issues

If you are experiencing difficulties connecting Oneleet to Google Workspace due to sign-in restrictions imposed by your security policies, you will need to manually configure an exemption for Oneleet. This involves using a special identifier known as an OAuth Client ID to bypass certain API security policies and set the Oneleet Google application as a trusted app. Follow these steps to resolve the connection issues:

1. Open your Google Admin console at [https://admin.google.com/](https://admin.google.com/).
2. In the sidebar, navigate to **Security** > **Access and data control** > **API controls**.
3. Click on **Manage third-party app access**.
4. Select **Add app**, then choose **OAuth App Name or Client ID**.
5. Enter the client ID `487371732991-7o3p4g81rmvdj7vj8sh9kh4rqfk5hhgc.apps.googleusercontent.com` and search.
6. Select the Oneleet application from the search results (there should only be one listed).
7. Choose the users or groups you would like to allow to log in to Oneleet's integration.
8. Set the application status to **Trusted** and select **Allowlist for exemption from API access blocks**.
9. Click **Finish** to complete the setup.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully connect Oneleet to your Google Workspace.

## Updates

### 2025-07-10

#### What's changing?

We're updating our Google Workspace integration to more reliably monitor your Gmail security configuration. As part of this change, we now require the following **additional permissions**:

- Cloud Identity Read-only Access

After this change, your monitors should exhibit fewer false positives.

#### Action required

Please reconnect your Google Workspace integration and accept the new permissions as soon as possible. **If your Google Workspace connection is failing, this should resolve the issue.** Your existing connection settings will be preserved.

1. On the Oneleet platform, go to Integrations → Google Workspace → "Settings" tab.
2. Under **Active connections**, find your connection and click **Reconnect**. Do **not** remove the entire integration.
3. Click "Connect", and authorize the new permissions.

Repeat this for any additional Google Workspace connections you have.
