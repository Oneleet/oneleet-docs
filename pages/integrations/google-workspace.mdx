### Troubleshooting Connection Issues

If you are experiencing difficulties connecting Oneleet to Google Workspace due to sign-in restrictions imposed by your security policies, you will need to manually configure an exemption for Oneleet. This involves using a special identifier known as an OAuth Client ID to bypass certain API security policies and set the Oneleet Google application as a trusted app. Follow these steps to resolve the connection issues:

1. Open your Google Admin console at [https://admin.google.com/](https://admin.google.com/).
2. In the sidebar, navigate to **Security** > **Access and data control** > **API controls**.
3. Click on **Manage third-party app access**.
4. Select **Add app**, then choose **OAuth App Name or Client ID**.
5. Enter the client ID `487371732991-7o3p4g81rmvdj7vj8sh9kh4rqfk5hhgc.apps.googleusercontent.com` and search.
6. Select the Oneleet application from the search results (there should only be one listed).
7. Choose the users or groups you would like to allow to log in to Oneleet's integration.
8. Set the application status to **Trusted** and select **Allowlist for exemption from API access blocks**.
9. Click **Finish** to complete the setup.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully connect Oneleet to your Google Workspace.
