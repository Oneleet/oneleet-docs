- Repository administration

- Organization members
- Organization webhooks

### Which resources does Oneleet monitor?

Oneleet currently monitors the following on GitHub:

## Common Issues

### I'm seeing "Please upgrade to GitHub Teams or above" for some of my repositories

This issue may arise if your repository is private and your GitHub organization is on a free plan. The free plan does not support the necessary configuration that the monitor checks for in private repositories.

To resolve this, you'll need to upgrade your GitHub organization to the paid Teams plan or above.
