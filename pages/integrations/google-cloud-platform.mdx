## Google Cloud VPC Setup

### What is a VPC?
Virtual Private Clouds are virtual networks in GCP. They're most commonly used to allow services to communicate with each other. VPCs allow you to control access to services and resources you host on GCP, and the firewall and routing systems prevent unauthorized network access.

### Basic VPC Setup Guide


1. Open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome).
2. Open "VPC networks" from the search bar.
3. Click "Create VPC Network" from the title bar.
4. Name your VPC (name can only contain letters, numbers, and -)
5. Add a new subnet
    - Subnets are a complex subject, for this guide just make sure the IP range isn't already used within your organization / network.
    - Name your subnet something relevant to the VPC. Example: VPC-NAME-1
    - Select your preferred GCP region. Example: us-central1
    - Pick an IPv4 range, these will be the IP addresses assigned to services in the VPC. Make sure the range is available in your network. If you're unfamiliar CIDR notation, 10.25.0.0/24 would be 10.25.0.0 to 10.25.0.255. 
6. Enable "Flow logs" for additional security.
7. Click "Create" to complete the process.

Now you will be able to assign services to your VPC from the configuration UI of those services.
