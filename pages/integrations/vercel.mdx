# Vercel

## Setup
To setup the Vercel integration, navigate to the **Integrations > Add integration > Vercel** and click **Continue**.

Oneleet requires an API key to access your Vercel team. We'll walk you through the process of creating a [Vercel API Token](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#creating-an-access-token) for your company's Vercel account.
### Creating an Access Token
Access Tokens can be created and managed from inside your [account settings](https://vercel.com/account/tokens).

1. In the upper-right corner of your [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard), click your profile picture, then select **Settings**
2. Select **Tokens** from the sidebar
3. Enter a descriptive name for the token
4. Choose the scope from the list of Teams in the drop-down menu. The scope ensures that only your specific Team can use an Access Token
5. From the **Expiration** drop-down, choose "No Expiration" to create a token that never expires
6. Click **Create Token**
7. Once you've created an Access Token, securely store the value as it will not be shown again.
### Vercel Team ID
Go to your Vercel team's settings to find your team ID.
