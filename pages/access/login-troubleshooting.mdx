# Login troubleshooting

If you're having trouble logging in to Oneleet, try following the steps below:

<Steps>
### 1. Close all Oneleet tabs and start in a fresh browser tab

First, close every browser tab that you currently have open for Oneleet across all windows. Then, open a single new browser tab and try logging in again.

> Having multiple Oneleet login pages open at once can cause session mismatches and prevent a successful login.

### 2. Clear your cookies and site data

Clear all Oneleet-related cookies and site data (including `auth.oneleet.com` and `oneleet.com`), then try logging in again.

> **Example:** clearing cookies and site data in Chrome

### 3. Force a logout

1. Open a new browser tab
2. Visit `https://api.oneleet.com/api/v1/users/logout/app`  
   • If you’re redirected to the login page, try logging in again  
   • If you see an **Unauthorized** message, move on to the next step

> Visiting the above URL ends your current session and can sometimes resolve issues with stale sessions

### 4. Try an incognito window

Try logging in through an incognito/private browser window.

### 5. Try a different browser

Try logging in with another browser.

### 6. Issues with two-factor authentication

If you're having issues with two-factor authentication codes not working:

##### 1. Check if you're using the right code

Double check that you're using the right code for the email you're trying to log in with, and not a code that you set up for a different email.

##### 2. Make sure your device's clock is properly synced

If you followed the normal setup flow for two-factor authentication and your codes are simply not working, confirm that your device clock is synced with the respective clock servers:

- **Apple devices**: Follow [Apple's time sync guide](https://support.apple.com/en-al/101619) (see section "Set the date and time automatically")
- **Android devices**: Follow [Google's time sync guide](https://support.google.com/googleplay/thread/55723112?hl=en&msgid=55728968) or [Android's date & time settings](https://support.google.com/android/answer/2841106?hl=en)
- **Windows devices**: Follow [Microsoft's time zone guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-set-your-time-and-time-zone-dfaa7122-479f-5b98-2a7b-fa0b6e01b261) and make sure it's configured correctly

### 7. Get in touch

If none of the above works, reach out to us via your dedicated Slack channel with us or at support@oneleet.com and share the details below so we can help resolve your issue more quickly:

1. A screenshot of the error page you're seeing
2. The URL of the error page
3. If you're trying to log in with Google and your email recently changed because your company migrated to a new domain, please include both your previous and new email addresses
