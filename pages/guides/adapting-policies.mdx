# Adapting policies to your organization

Implementing security policies that align with your organization's specific needs is crucial for effective compliance. Our platform offers two types of policy templates to assist you in this process:

- **Formal (Minimum Viable Policies)**: These templates cover essential security guidelines.
- **Comprehensive**: These are more detailed policies that include stricter requirements, ideal for organizations aiming to adopt comprehensive frameworks like ISO 27001 in the future.

## Adapting Policies

When customizing the templates, focus on adjusting the language to reflect your organization's practices without altering the core intent of the policies. We recommend retaining most of the guidelines but adapting the wording to fit your organizational setup.

**Example:**

- Original Policy Statement:
    
    > 1. Keys and key cards are provided to a subset of employees and are granted on a needs-oriented basis.

- Adapted Policy Statement (if using pin codes instead of keys):
    
    > 1. Access pin codes are provided to a subset of employees and are granted on a needs-oriented basis.


This ensures the policy remains relevant and accurately represents your security measures.

For certifications like **SOC 2 Type II**, it's essential to demonstrate that your organization follows its stated policies and procedures. Our platform's controls are designed to guide you in providing the necessary evidence.

## Need Assistance?

If you have questions about specific guidelines in the policies or need help applying anything to your organization, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're here to help ensure that your security program is both effective and tailored to your company's unique needs.

**Remember:** The goal is to maintain best security practices while making policies practical and applicable to your organization's environment.
