Generate a secret key and tore this in a safe place as it's the only way to access your account each time you want to log in from an unrecognized device.

2. From here, there are a number of options, like allowing only access from specified domains or specifying the maximum expiration time for a link:
   ![](/1password/1Password-13.png)

For additional security, we recommend you to setup specific approved domains, so you know who can access the links that your team shares.

This can be done by selecting the "People with an email address at an approved domain":
![](/1password/1Password-14.png)

And then you can setup your approved domains by clicking on "Manage approved domains" and filling out the domains you want to allow:

## Invite your Team

We highly recommend to read through the [onboarding your team guide](https://blog.1password.com/rolling-out-1password-tips-for-onboarding-your-team/) provided by 1password, but we'll guide you through the basic steps to invite your team either way.

First, go to your invitations page by clicking "Invitations" on your right navbar:

<Tabs items={["Invite by Email", "Invite by Sign-Up Link"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    First, click on "Invite By email"

![](/1password/1Password-20.png)

    Now it's as simple as filling out which emails you want to invite to your team and click on Invite!

![](/1password/1Password-21.png)

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    The invite by Sign-Up Link method is the most convinient of all, you'll be allowed to setup some domains your team uses and just share a link! To do so, click in "View Link and Options" under the Sign-Up Link card

![](/1password/1Password-22.png)

    This will expand a section with your email domain already prefilled. If you don't want to add any other email, your link is ready to share with your team!

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Once your teams have registered with their emails, their accounts need to be confirmed by an owner or an administrator of the 1password team. This can be done from the same invitations screen, and is as simple as clicking on the confirm button next to the users email!

After you clicked on confirm, you're done! Your team members will be able to explode the full security advantages that 1password provides!

## Generating Reports

Once your team is onboarded and everyone has started using 1password, you'll want to generate security reports. We recommend you do this at least once a month. To do so, you can following this guide:
