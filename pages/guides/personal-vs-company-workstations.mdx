# Personal vs company workstations

Choosing the right devices for your business operations is very important for maintaining a strong security posture. While using company issued workstations is not a requirement for SOC 2 compliance—you can achieve compliance with a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy—we strongly recommend using dedicated company devices.

### **Risks associated with BYOD policies**

Having a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy introduces several security challenges:

- **Increased attack surface**: Personal devices often have a multitude of applications installed—sometimes in the 100s—that are not necessary for business operations. Many of these are consumer-focused apps and may not adhere to the same security standards as business applications.
- **Inconsistent security measures**: Personal devices may lack essential security configurations, consistent updates, and patches, making them susceptible to attacks.
- **Data control issues**: Managing and protecting sensitive company data becomes more difficult when it resides on personal devices outside of your direct control.
- **Device loss or theft**: Personal devices are more likely to be used in various locations, increasing the risk of loss or theft.
- **Mixed use concerns**: When work and personal activities occur on the same device, there’s an increased risk of accidental data exposure or security breaches.
- **Complex offboarding**: Removing company data and access from personal devices during employee departures can be challenging.

### **Advantages of company-issued devices**

Using company-owned devices offers several benefits:

- **Full control over device configuration**: You have complete authority over how company devices are configured, used, and stored, allowing you to enforce security policies effectively.
- **Less employee pushback on policies**: Since the devices are company-owned, employees are more likely to accept security measures as standard protocol.
- **Standardized security**: Uniform security measures can be implemented across all devices, making management and updates more efficient.
- **Simplified asset management**: Better tracking and management of hardware and software assets.
- **Clearer boundaries**: Clear separation between work and personal activities reduces risk of data breaches.
- **Streamlined support**: IT support becomes more efficient with standardized hardware and software configurations.

### **BYOD best practices**

If you believe a BYOD policy better suits your organization, here are some best practices to ensure you're being thoughtful about security:

**Make requirements clear**

- Publish an acceptable use policy and ensure all employees are aware of their responsibilities. Leverage Oneleet’s policy templates for best practices and security guidance.

**Utilize the Oneleet agent**

- Require employees to install the Oneleet agent on their personal devices before accessing company resources.
- Use the Oneleet dashboard to ensure basic end-user device security requirements such as encryption and antivirus are enforced on all workstations.

**Train on best practices**

- Educate employees on best practices for securing their devices and recognizing potential threats.
- Teach employees to identify phishing emails, suspicious links, and unsafe downloads by checking signs such as sender details, URLs, or email tone.
- Ensure employees are not storing sensitive data in personal cloud accounts or non-approved storage by providing secure alternatives.

**Remember:** Whether you choose company-owned devices or BYOD, prioritizing security is essential for safeguarding your organization's assets.
