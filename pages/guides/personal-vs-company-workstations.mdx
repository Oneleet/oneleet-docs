# Personal devices vs company managed workstations

Choosing the right devices for your business operations is crucial for maintaining a strong security posture. While using company issued workstations is not a requirement for SOC 2 compliance—you can achieve compliance with a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy—we strongly recommend using dedicated company devices.

## Risks Associated with BYOD Policies

Having a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy introduces several security challenges:

- **Increased Attack Surface**: Personal devices often have a multitude of applications installed—sometimes in the 100s—that are not necessary for business operations. Many of these are consumer-focused apps and may not adhere to the same security standards as business applications.
- **Inconsistent Security Measures**: Personal devices may lack essential security configurations, consistent updates, and patches, making them susceptible to attacks.
- **Data Control Issues**: Managing and protecting sensitive company data becomes more difficult when it resides on personal devices outside of your direct control.
- **Device Loss or Theft**: Personal devices are more likely to be used in various locations, increasing the risk of loss or theft.
- **Mixed Use Concerns**: When work and personal activities occur on the same device, there's an increased risk of accidental data exposure or security breaches.
- **Complex Offboarding**: Removing company data and access from personal devices during employee departures can be challenging.

## Advantages of Company-Issued Devices

Using company-owned devices offers several benefits:

- **Full Control Over Device Configuration**: You have complete authority over how company devices are configured, used, and stored, allowing you to enforce security policies effectively.
- **Less Employee Pushback on Policies**: Since the devices are company-owned, employees are more likely to accept security measures as standard protocol.
- **Standardized Security**: Uniform security measures can be implemented across all devices, making management and updates more efficient.
- **Simplified Asset Management**: Better tracking and management of hardware and software assets.
- **Clearer Boundaries**: Clear separation between work and personal activities reduces risk of data breaches.
- **Streamlined Support**: IT support becomes more efficient with standardized hardware and software configurations.

## **BYOD Done Right: How to Make It Work If You Believe It's the Best Fit**

If you believe a BYOD policy better suits your organization, here are some best practices to ensure you're being thoughtful about security:

- **Make Requirements Clear**: Clearly define security requirements, acceptable use, and employee responsibilities when using personal devices for work.
- **Utilize a MDM Solution**: Employ a MDM tool to ensure basic security requirements such as encryption and antivirus are enforced.
- **Train on Best Practices**: Educate employees on best practices for securing their devices and recognizing potential threats.

**Remember:** Whether you choose company-owned devices or BYOD, prioritizing security is essential for safeguarding your organization's assets.
